# Brigade 2: Event-based Scripting for Kubernetes

Brigade 2 is currently under heavy development.

Further documentation will become available as the corresponding code is
committed.

In the meantime, please visit the [Brigade 2 Proposal](../2.0-PROPOSAL/README.md)
to learn about the rationale, design principals, and architecture behind the
current development effort.

Also, the first (relatively) stable piece of Brigade 2 exists in the form of
an SDK for Go-- and it remains compatible with the Brigade 2 prototype. Any
developers wishing to work on tools, event gateways, etc. in parallel with the
Brigade 2.0 development effort can begin using this SDK immediately. See the
SDK's [own docs](sdk/README.md) for further details.
