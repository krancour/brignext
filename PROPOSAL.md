# Toward a Better Brigade

In the time since its first major release, Brigade has proven itself a useful
and moderately popular platform for achieving _"event-driven scripting for
Kubernetes."_ Technology changes rapidly however, hindsight is 20/20, and thanks
both to issues opened by our community and the maintainers' own efforts to "dog
food" the product, we are acutely aware of numerous usability issues,
limitations, and highly-desired features, many of which require breaking changes
and a re-architected product in order to move forward. _In other words, it is
time to talk about Brigade 2.0._

## TL;DR

Brigade 2.0 is proposed to improve usability, security, and flexability by
leveraging revised architecture and technology choices while remaining faithful
to the product's original intent. A succinct summary of the proposed changes is
a nuanced transition from "event-driven scripting for Kubernetes" to "event
driven scripting (for Kubernetes)."
